But osslsigncode is based on OpenSSL and cURL,\r\nand thus should be able to compile on most platforms where these exist.\r\n\r\n## WHY?\r\n\r\nWhy not use signtool.exe? Because I don't want to go to a Windows\r\nmachine every time I need to sign a binary - I can compile and build\r\nthe binaries using Wine on my Linux machine, but I can't sign them\r\nsince the signtool.exe makes good use of the CryptoAPI in Windows, and\r\nthese APIs aren't (yet?) fully implemented in Wine, so the signtool.exe\r\ntool  would fail. And, so, osslsigncode was born.\r\n\r\n## WHAT CAN IT DO?\r\n\r\nIt can sign and timestamp PE (EXE/SYS/DLL/etc), CAB, CAT and MSI files.\r\nIt supports the equivalent of signtool.exe's \"-j javasign.dll -jp low\",\r\ni.e. add a valid signature for a CAB file containing Java files.\r\nIt supports getting the timestamp through a proxy as well. It also\r\nsupports signature verification, removal and extraction.\r\n","ProjectUrl":"https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode","PackageSourceUrl":"https://github.com/zverev-iv/choco-osslsigncode","ProjectSourceUrl":null,"DocsUrl":"https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode#readme","MailingListUrl":null,"BugTrackerUrl":"https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/issues","Tags":["OpenSSL","signtool","Authenticode","signing","timestamp","PE","EXE","SYS","DLL","CAB","MSI"],"Copyright":"2005-2014 Per Allansson, 2018-2019 Michał Trojnara","LicenseUrl":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/master/LICENSE.txt","RequireLicenseAcceptance":false,"IconUrl":null,"ReleaseNotes":["https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode/releases/"],"Files":[{"Source":"bin/**","Target":"tools","Exclude":null}],"Dependencies":[],"Version":"2.6.0","OutputDirectory":null,"Debug":false,"Verbose":false,"Trace":false,"NoColor":false,"AcceptLicense":false,"Force":false,"Noop":false,"LimitOutput":false,"ExecutionTimeout":0,"CacheLocation":null,"AllowUnofficial":false,"FailOnErrorOutput":false,"UseSystemPowerShell":false,"NoProgress":false,"Proxy":null,"ProxyUser":null,"ProxyPassword":null,"ProxyByPassList":null,"ProxyBypassOnLocal":false,"LogFile":null,"SkipCompatibilityChecks":false,"ToolPath":null,"ToolTimeout":null,"WorkingDirectory":null,"NoWorkingDirectory":false,"ArgumentCustomization":null,"EnvironmentVariables":{},"HandleExitCode":null,"PostAction":null,"SetupProcessSettings":null}}
